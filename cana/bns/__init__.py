BNS Attractors Interface
==========================

This module interfaces CANA with the [B]oolean [N]etworks with [S]ynchronous update (BNS) :cite:`Dubrova:2011` to compute attractors.

	BNS is a software tool for computing attractors in Boolean Networks with Synchronous update.
	Synchronous Boolean networks are used for the modeling of genetic regulatory networks. 

	BNS implements the algorithm presented in which is based on a SAT-based bounded model checking.
	BNS uses much less space compared to BooleNet or other BDD-based approaches for computing attractors.
	It can handle several orders of magnitude larger networks. 



.. Note::

	You must have ``bns`` compiled for you system. Alternatively, you can download the binary from the `bns website <https://people.kth.se/~dubrova/bns.html>`_ directly.
