Feedback Vertex Set
====================

The NP-complete Feedback Vertex Set (FVS) problem is defined as the minimum number of vertices
that need to be removed from a directed graph so that the resulting graph has no direct cycle. :cite:`Pardalos:1998` :cite:`Mochizuki:2013`.

Two methods are implemented here. A bruteforce and the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) method by :cite:`Pardalos:1998`.
